This subfolder contains the code for the 25th of October deadline of the Numerics assignment .

In file main.py there is the main code for the Linear Advection equation problem. It calls three numerical methods 
for two different initial conditions (one non smooth at x=0.5 and the other smooth) and plots the results.

The files FTCSAlone.py, CTCSAlone.py and CTBSAlone.py are the codes for the relative nomerical schemes.
The file L_norm_errors.py is the code for computing the l_1, l_2 and l_infty error norms.

NOTE :
I have seen that CTBS does not perform well when given a non smooth initial condition, while it behaves good 
when the initial condition is smooth. Still to really understand why. 
I am going to implement an implicit method in the following, and I will decide which of the 4 total methods ( if not all)
I will evenutally use in my final report.
