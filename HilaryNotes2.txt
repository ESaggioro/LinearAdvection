I cannot run your code because main_LinearAdvection.py contains the line:
exec(open("./Grid.py").read()) 
whereas your file is called Grid.py
I am using a case sensitive operating system. I fixed this but then the code gave another error running
python3 main_LinearAdvection.py 

Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: x and y must have same first dimension

Your design of the time-stepping in CTCS is not good. You shouldn't have a whole other loop for the case tsteps = 1. If you only run for one time-step, this should be handled by FTBS (as is the first time-step if tsteps>1). 

If tsteps = 0, CTCS returns the wrong result.
